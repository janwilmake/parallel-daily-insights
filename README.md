# Recurring Tasks Using cronjobs and KV

See [SPEC](SPEC.md)

Part of the [cookbook](https://github.com/parallel-web/parallel-cookbook)

TODO:

- ✅ daily cronjob seems broken, fix it
- ✅ add basis confidence and citations to each property.
- ✅ show feed per task (reverse chronologically)
- ✅ ensure to link to the github from each page

Questions:

- How to avoid getting 'low' confidence properties? They aren't useful
- How does the API handle things like 'today'? What is the best time in the day to run the task?
